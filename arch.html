<p>This section identifies the main architectural components of cellular
access networks. It focuses on the components that are common to both
4G and 5G, and as such, establishes a foundation for understanding the
advanced features of 5G presented in the sections that follow.</p>
<p>This overview is partly an exercise in introducing 3GPP
terminology. For someone that is familiar with the Internet, this
terminology can seem arbitrary (e.g., &#x201C;eNB&#x201D; is a &#x201C;base station&#x201D;), but
it is important to keep in mind that this terminology came out of the
3GPP standardization process, which has historically been concerned
about telephony and almost completely disconnected from the IETF and
other Internet-related efforts. To further confuse matters, the 3GPP
terminology often changes with each generation (e.g., a base station
is called eNB in 4G and gNB in 5G). We address situations like this by
using generic terminology (e.g., base station), and referencing the
3GPP-specific counterpart only when the distinction is helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This example is only the tip of the terminology iceberg. For a
slightly broader perspective on the complexity of terminology in 5G,
see Marcin Dryjanski&#x2019;s

</blockquote>
<h2 id="main-components">Main Components</h2>
<p>The cellular network provides wireless connectivity to devices that
are on the move. These devices, which are known as <em>User Equipment
(UE)</em>, have until recently corresponded to smartphones and tablets,
but will increasingly include cars, drones, industrial and
agricultural machines, robots, home appliances, medical devices, and
so on.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="cellular"></a>

    <figcaption>Figure 3.1: Cellular networks consists of a Radio
    Access Network (RAN) and a Mobile Core.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As shown in <a href="#cellular">Figure 3.1</a>, the cellular network consists of
two main subsystems: the <em>Radio Access Network (RAN)</em> and the <em>Mobile
Core</em>. The RAN manages the radio spectrum, making sure it is both used
efficiently and meets the quality-of-service requirements of every
user. The main component in the RAN is the crypticly named <em>eNodeB</em>
(or <em>eNB</em>), which is short for the equally cryptic <em>evolved Node
B</em>. The Mobile Core is a bundle of functionality (as opposed to a
device) that serves several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides Internet (IP) connectivity for both data and voice services.</li>
<li>Ensures this connectivity fulfills the promised QoS requirements.</li>
<li>Tracks user mobility to ensure uninterrupted service.</li>
<li>Tracks subscriber usage for billing and charging.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mobile Core is another example of a generic term. In 4G this is called
the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and in 5G it is called the Next
Generation Core (NG-Core).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though the word &#x201C;Core&#x201D; is in its name, from an Internet
perspective, the Mobile Core is still part of the access network,
effectively providing a bridge between the RAN and the IP-world.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at <a href="#cellular">Figure 3.1</a>, we see that a
<em>Backhaul Network</em> interconnects the eNBs that implement the RAN with
the Mobile Core. This network is typically wired, may or may not have
the ring topology shown in the Figure, and is often constructed from
commodity components found elsewhere in the Internet. For example, the
Passive Optical Network (PON) that implements Fiber-to-the-Home is a
prime candidate for implementing the RAN backhaul. The backhaul
network is obviously a necessary part of the RAN, but it is an
implementation choice and not prescribed by the 3GPP standard.</p>
<p>Although 3GPP specifies all the elements that implement the RAN and
Mobile Core in an open standard&#x2014;including sub-layers we have not yet
introduced&#x2014;network operators have historically bought proprietary
implementations of each subsystem from a single vendor. This lack of
an open source implementation contributes to the perceived
&#x201C;opaqueness&#x201D; of the cellular network in general, and the RAN in
particular. And while it is true that an eNodeB implementation does
contain sophisticated algorithms for scheduling transmission on the
radio spectrum&#x2014;algorithms that are considered valuable Intellectual
Property of the equipment vendors&#x2014;there is significant opportunity to
open and disaggregate both the RAN and the Mobile Core. The following
two sections describe each, in turn.</p>
<p>Before getting to those details, <a href="#cups">Figure 3.2</a> redraws the
components from <a href="#cellular">Figure 3.1</a> to highlight two important
distinctions. The first is that the eNB (which we will refer to as the
Base Station from here on) has an analog component (depicted by an
antenna) and a digital component (depicted by a processor). The second
is that the Mobile Core is partitioned into a <em>Control Plane</em> and
<em>User Plane</em>, which is similar to the control/data plane split that
someone familiar with the Internet would recognize. (3GPP also
recently introduced a corresponding acronym&#x2014;<em>CUPS, Control and User
Plane Separation</em>&#x2014;to denote this idea). The importance of these two
distinctions will become clear in the following discussion.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<h2 id="radio-access-network">Radio Access Network</h2>
<p>We now describe the RAN by sketching the role each base station
plays. Keep in mind this is kind of like describing the Internet by
explaining how a router works&#x2014;a not unreasonable place to start, but
it doesn&#x2019;t fully do justice to the end-to-end story.</p>
<p>First, each base station establishes the wireless channel for a
subscriber&#x2019;s UE upon power-up or upon handover when the UE is
active. This channel is released when the UE remains idle for a
predetermined period of time. Using 3GPP terminology, this wireless
channel is said to provide a bearer service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &#x201C;bearer&#x201D; has historically been used in telecommunications
(including early wireline technologies like ISDN) to denote &#x201C;data,&#x201D; as
opposed to a channel that carries &#x201C;signalling&#x201D; information.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
    <a id="active-ue"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide03.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Figure 3.3: Base Station detects (and connects to)
    active UEs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Second, each base station establishes &#x201D;3GPP Control Plane&#x201D;
connectivity between the UE and the corresponding Mobile Core Control
Plane component, and forwards signaling traffic between the two. This
signaling traffic enables UE authentication, registration, mobility
tracking.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="control-plane"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide04.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>FIgure 3.4: Base Station establishes control plane
    connectivity between each UE and the Mobile Core.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Third, for each active UE, the base station establishes one or more
tunnels between the corresponding Mobile Core User Plane component.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="user-plane"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide05.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Figure 3.5: Base station establishes one or more
    tunnels between each UE and the Mobile Core&apos;s User
    Plane.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fourth, the base station forwards both control and user plane packets
between the Mobile Core and the UE. These packets are tunnelled over
SCTP/IP and GTP/UDP/IP, respectively. SCTP (Stream Control Transport
Protocol) is 3GPP-defined alternative to TCP, tailored to carry
signalling (control) information for telephony services. GTP (a nested
acronym corresponding to (General Packet Radio Service) Tunneling
Protocol) is a 3GPP-specific tunneling protocol designed to run over
UDP.</p>
<p>As an aside, it is noteworthy that connectivity between the RAN and
the Mobile Core is IP-based. This was introduced as one of the main
changes between 3G and 4G. Prior to 4G, the internals of the cellular
network were circuit-based, which is not surprising given its origins
as a voice network.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="tunnels"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide06.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>FIgure 3.6: Base Station to Mobile Core (and Base
    Station to Base Station) control plane tunneled over SCTP/IP and
    user plane tunneled over GTP/UDP/IP.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fifth, the base station coordinates UE handovers between neighboring
base stations, using direct station-to-station links. Exactly like the
station-to-core connectivity shown in the previous figure, these links
are used to transfer both control plane (SCTP over IP) and user plane
(GTP over UDP/IP) packets.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="handover"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide07.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>FIgure 3.7: Base Stations cooperate to implement UE
    hand over.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sixth, the base station coordinates wireless multi-point transmission
to a UE from multiple base stations, which may or may not be part of a
UE handover from one base station to another.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="link-aggregation"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide08.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Figure 3.8: Base Stations cooperate to implement
    multipath transmission (link aggregation) to UEs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For our purposes, the main takeaway is that the base station can be
viewed as a specialized forwarder. In the Internet-to-UE direction, it
fragments outgoing IP packets into physical layer segments and
schedules them for transmission over the available radio spectrum, and
in the UE-to-Internet direction it assembles physical layer segments
into IP packets and forwards them (over a GTP/UDP/IP tunnel) to the
upstream user plane of the Mobile Core. Also, based on observations of
the wireless channel quality and per-subscriber policies, it decides
whether to (a) forward outgoing packets directly to the UE, (b)
indirectly forward packets to the UE via a neighboring base station,
or (c) utilize multiple paths to reach the UE. The third case has the
option of either spreading the physical payloads across multiple base
stations or across multiple carrier frequencies of a single base
station (including Wi-Fi).</p>
<p>Note that as outlined in the previous section, scheduling is complex
and multi-faceted, even when viewed as a localized decision at a
single base station. What we now see is that there is also a global
element, whereby it&#x2019;s possible to forward traffic to a different base
station (or to multiple base stations) in an effort to make efficient
use of the radio spectrum over a larger geographic area.</p>
<p>In other words, the RAN as a whole (i.e., not just a single base
station) not only supports handovers (an obvious requirement for
mobility), but also <em>link aggregation</em> and <em>load balancing</em>,
mechanisms that are familiar to anyone that understands the
Internet. We will revisit how such RAN-wide (global) decisions can be
made using SDN techniques in a later section.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-core">Mobile Core</h2>
<p>The main function of the Mobile Core is to provide external packet
data network (e.g., Internet) connectivity to mobile subscribers,
while ensuring that they are authenticated and their observed service
qualities satisfy their subscription SLAs. An important aspect of the
Mobile Core is that it needs to manage all subscribers&#x2019; mobility by
keeping track of their last whereabouts at the granularity of the
serving base station.</p>
<p>While the aggregate functionality remains largely the same as we
migrate from 4G to 5G, how that functionality is virtualized and
factored into individual components changes, with the 5G Mobile Core
heavily influenced by the cloud&#x2019;s march towards a microservice-based
(cloud native) architecture. This shift to cloud native is deeper than
it might first appear, in part because it opens the door to
customization and specialization. Instead of supporting just voice and
broadband connectivity, the 5G Mobile Core can evolve to also support,
for example, massive IoT, which has a fundamentally different latency
requirement and usage pattern (e.g., many more devices connecting
intermittently). This stresses&#x2014;if not breaks&#x2014;a one-size-fits-all
approach to session management.</p>
<h3 id="4g-mobile-core">4G Mobile Core</h3>
<p>The 4G Mobile Core, which 3GPP officially refers to as the <em>Evolved
Packet Core (EPC)</em>, consists of five main components, the first three
of which run in the Control Plane (CP) and the second two of which run
in the User Plane (UP):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MME (Mobility Management Entity): Tracks and manages the movement of
UEs throughout the RAN. This includes recording when the UE is not
active.</p>
</li>
<li><p>HSS (Home Subscriber Server): A database that contains all
subscriber-related information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>PCRF (Policy &amp; Charging Rules Function): Tracks and manages policy
rules and records billing data on subscriber traffic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>SGW (Serving Gateway): Forwards IP packets to and from the
RAN. Anchors the Mobile Core end of the bearer service to a
(potentially mobile) UE, and so is involved in handovers from one
base station to another.</p>
</li>
<li><p>PGW (Packet Gateway): Essentially an IP router, connecting the
Mobile Core to the external Internet. Supports additional
access-related functions, including policy enforcement, traffic
shaping, and charging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although specified as distinct components, in practice the SGW
(RAN-facing) and PGW (Internet-facing) are often combined in a single
device, commonly referred to as an S/PGW. The end result is
illustrated in <a href="#4g-core">Figure 3.9</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="4g-core"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide20.png" width="700px">
    <figcaption>Figure 3.9: 4G Mobile Core (Evolved Packet
    Core).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note that 3GPP is flexible in how the Mobile Core components are
deployed to serve a geographic area. For example, a single MME/PGW
pair might serve a metropolitan area, with SGWs deployed across ~10
edge sites spread throughout the city, each of which serves ~100 base
stations. But alternative deployment configurations are allowed by the
spec.</p>
<h3 id="5g-mobile-core">5G Mobile Core</h3>
<p>The 5G Mobile Core, which 3GPP calls the <em>NG-Core</em>, adopts a
microservice-like architecture, where we say &#x201C;microservice-like&#x201D;
because while the 3GPP specification spells out this level of
disaggregation, it is really just prescribing a set of functional
blocks and not an implementation. Keeping in mind a set of functional
blocks is very different from the collection of engineering decisions
that go into designing a microservice-based system, viewing the
collection of components shown in <a href="#5g-core">Figure 3.10</a> as a set of
microservices is a good working model.</p>
<p>The following organizes the set of functional blocks into three
groups. The first group runs in the Control Plane (CP) and has a
counterpart in the EPC:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AMF (Core Access and Mobility Management Function): Manages the
mobility-related aspects of the EPC&#x2019;s MME. Responsible for
connection and reachability management, mobility management, access
authentication and authorization, and location services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>SMF (Session Management Function): Manages each UE session,
including IP address allocation, selection of associated UP
function, control aspects of QoS, and control aspects of UP
routing. Roughly corresponds to part of the EPC&#x2019;s MME and the
control-related aspects of the EPC&#x2019;s PGW.</p>
</li>
<li><p>PCF (Policy Control Function): Manages the policy rules that other
CP functions then enforce. Roughly corresponds to the EPC&#x2019;s PCRF.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UDM (Unified Data Management): Manages user identity, including the
generation of authentication credentials. Includes part of the
functionality in the EPC&#x2019;s HSS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>AUSF (Authentication Server Function): Essentially an authentication
server. Includes part of the functionality in the EPC&#x2019;s HSS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second group also runs in the Control Plane (CP) but does not have
a counterpart in the EPC:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SDSF (Structured Data Storage Network Function): A &#x201C;helper&#x201D; service
used to store structured data.  Might be implemented by an &#x201C;SQL
Database&#x201D; in a microservices-based system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UDSF (Unstructured Data Storage Network Function): A &#x201C;helper&#x201D;
service used to store unstructured data. Might be implemented by a
&#x201C;Key/Value Store&#x201D; in a microservices-based system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>NEF (Network Exposure Function): A means to expose select
capabilities to third-party services, including translation between
internal and external representations for data. Might be implemented
by an &#x201C;API Server&#x201D; in a microservices-based system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>NFR (NF Repository Function): A means to discover available
services. Might be implemented by a &#x201C;Discovery Service&#x201D; in a
microservices-based system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>NSSF (Network Slicing Selector Function): A means to select a
Network Slice to serve a given UE. Network slices are essentially a
way to differentiate service given to different users. It is a key
feature of 5G that we discuss in depth later in this tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The third group includes the one component that runs in the User Plane
(UP):</p>
<ul>
<li>UPF (User Plane Function): Forwards traffic between RAN and the
Internet, corresponding to the S/PGW combination in EPC. In addition
to packet forwarding, responsible for policy enforcement, lawful
intercept, traffic usage reporting, and QoS policing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the first and third groups are best viewed as a
straightforward refactoring of 4G&#x2019;s EPC, while the second
group&#x2014;despite the gratuitous introduction of new terminology&#x2014;is 3GPP&#x2019;s
way of pointing to a cloud native solution as the desired end-state
for the Mobile Core. Of particular note, introducing distinct storage
services means that all the other services can be stateless, and
hence, more readily scalable. Also note that <a href="#5g-core">Figure 3.10</a>
adopts an idea that&#x2019;s common in microservice-based systems, namely, to
show a &#x201C;message bus&#x201D; interconnecting all the components rather than
including a full set of pairwise connections. This also suggests a
well-understood implementation strategy.</p>

</figure>

<p>Stepping back from these details, and with the caveat that we are
presuming an implementation, the main takeaway is that we can
conceptualize the Mobile Core as a <em>Service Mesh</em>. We adopt this
terminology for &#x201C;an interconnected set of microservices&#x201D; since it is
widely used in cloud native systems. Other terms you will sometimes
hear are <em>Service Graph</em> and <em>Service Chain</em>, the latter being more
prevalent in NFV-oriented documents. 3GPP is silent on the specific
terminology since it is considered an implementation choice rather
than part of the specification.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-options">Deployment Options</h2>
<p>With an already deployed 4G RAN/EPC in the field and a new 5G
RAN/NG-Core deployment underway, we can&#x2019;t ignore the issue of
transitioning from 4G to 5G (an issue the IP-world has been grappling
with for 20 years). 3GPP officially spells out multiple deployment
options, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand-Alone 4G  /  Stand-Alone 5G</li>
<li>Non-Stand-Alone (4G+5G RAN) over 4G&#x2019;s EPC</li>
<li>Non-Stand-Alone (4G+5G RAN) over 5G&#x2019;s NG-Core</li>
</ul>
<p>Focusing on the second pair, which imply incremental phasing, we see
two general strategies. The first is to connect new 5G base stations
to existing 4G-based EPCs, and then incrementally evolve the Mobile
Core by refactoring the components and adding NG-Core capabilities
over time. The second is to implement a backward-compatible NG-Core
that can support both 4G and 5G base stations, where the new NG-Core
could be implemented from scratch, but would likely start with the
existing EPC code base.</p>
<p>One reason we call attention to the phasing issue is that we face a
similar challenge in the sections that follow. The closer the
following discussion gets to implementation details, the more specific
we have to be about whether we are using 4G components or 5G
components. As a general rule, we use 4G components&#x2014;particularly with
respect to the Mobile Core, since that&#x2019;s the available open source
software&#x2014;and trust the reader can make the appropriate substitution
without loss of generality. Like the broader industry, the open source
community is in the process of incrementally evolving its 4G code base
into its 5G-compliant counterpart.</p>
