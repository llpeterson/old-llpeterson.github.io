## Build the Book 

To build a web-viewable version, you first need to install a couple
packages:

* [Gitbook Toolchain](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/setup.md)
* [Node.js Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) 

Then do the following to download the source:

```shell 
mkdir ~/5G
cd ~/5G
git clone https://github.com/SystemsApproach/5G.git 
cd 5G
```

To build a web version of the book, simply type:

```shell 
make 
```

If all goes well, you will be able to view the book in your browser at 
`localhost:4000`. (If all doesn't go well, you might try typing `make`
a second time.)
