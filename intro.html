<p>Cellular networks, which have a 40-year history that parallels the
Internet&#x2019;s, have undergone significant change. The first two
generations supported voice and then text, with 3G defining the
transition to broadband access, supporting data rates measured in
hundreds of kilobits-per-second. Today, the industry is at 4G
(supporting data rates typically measured in the few
megabits-per-second) and starting the transition to 5G, with the
promise of a tenfold increase in data rates.</p>
<p>But 5G is about much more than increased bandwidth. In the same way 3G
defined the transition from voice to broadband, 5G&#x2019;s promise is mostly
about the transition from a single access service (broadband
connectivity) to a richer collection of edge services and devices,
including support for immersive user interfaces (e.g., AR/VR),
mission-critical applications (e.g., public safety, autonomous
vehicles), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Because these use cases
will include everything from home appliances to industrial robots to
self-driving cars, 5G won&#x2019;t just support humans accessing the Internet
from their smartphones, but also swarms of autonomous devices working
together on their behalf. All of this requires a fundamentally
different architecture.</p>
<p>This book describes the 5G cellular network, which because it is on
an evolutionary path and not a point solution, includes standardized
specifications, a range of implementation choices, and a long list of
aspirational goals. Because this leaves so much room for
interpretation, our approach to describing 5G is grounded in two
mutually-supportive principles. The first is to apply a <em>systems lens</em>,
which is to say, we explain the sequence of design decisions that lead
to a solution rather than fall back on enumerating the overwhelming
number of acronyms as a <em>fait accompli</em>. The second is to aggressively
disaggregate the system. Building a disaggregated, virtualized, and
software-defined 5G access network is the direction the industry is
already headed (for good technical and business reasons), but breaking
the 5G network down into its elemental components is also the best way
to explain how 5G works. It also helps to illustrate how 5G might
evolve in the future to provide even more value.</p>
<p>What this all means is that there is no single, comprehensive
definition of 5G, any more than there is for the Internet. It is a
complex and evolving system, constrained by a set of standards that
purposely give all the stakeholders many degrees of freedom. In the
chapters that follow, it should be clear from the context whether we
are talking about <em>standards</em> (what everyone must do), <em>trends</em> (where
the industry seems to be headed), or <em>implementation choices</em>
(examples to make the discussion more concrete). By adopting a systems
perspective throughout, our intent is to describe 5G in a way that helps the
reader navigate this rich and rapidly evolving system.</p>
<h2 id="standardization-landscape">Standardization Landscape</h2>
<p>As of 3G, the generational designation corresponds to a standard
defined by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). Even though
its name has &quot;3G&quot; in it, the 3GPP continues to define the standard for
4G and 5G, each of which corresponds to a sequence of releases of the
standard. Release 15 is considered the demarcation point between 4G
and 5G, with Release 16 expected by the end of 2019. Complicating the
terminology, 4G was on a multi-release evolutionary path referred to
as <em>Long Term Evolution (LTE)</em>. 5G is on a similar evolutionary path,
with several expected releases over its lifetime.</p>
<p>While 5G is an ambitious advance beyond 4G, it is also the case that
understanding 4G is the first step to understanding 5G, as several
aspects of the latter can be explained as bringing a new
degree-of-freedom to the former. In the chapters that follow, we often
introduce some architectural feature of 4G as a way of laying the
foundation for the corresponding 5G component.</p>
<p>Like Wi-Fi, cellular networks transmit data at certain bandwidths in
the radio spectrum. Unlike Wi-Fi, which permits anyone to use a
channel at either 2.4 or 5 GHz (these are unlicensed bands),
governments have auctioned off and licensed exclusive use of various
frequency bands to service providers, who in turn sell mobile access
service to their subscribers.</p>
<p>There is also a shared-license band at 3.5-GHz, called <em>Citizens
Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)</em>, set aside in North America for
cellular use. Similar spectrum being set aside in other countries. The
CBRS band allows three tiers of users to share the spectrum: first
right of use goes to the original owners of this spectrum, naval
radars and satellite ground stations; followed by priority users who
receive this right over 10MHz bands for three years via regional
auctions; and finally the rest of the population, who can access and
utilize a portion of this band as long as they first check with a
central database of registered users. CBRS, along with standardization
efforts to extend cellular networks to operate in the unlicensed
bands, open the door for private cellular networks similar to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The specific frequency bands that are licensed for cellular networks
vary around the world, and are complicated by the fact that network
operators often simultaneously support both old/legacy technologies
and new/next-generation technologies, each of which occupies a
different frequency band. The high-level summary is that traditional
cellular technologies range from 700-MHz to 2400-MHz, with new
mid-spectrum allocations now happening at 6-GHz, and millimeter-wave
(mmWave) allocations opening above 24-GHz.</p>
<p>While the specific frequency band is not directly relevant to
understanding 5G from an architectural perspective, it does impact the
physical-layer components, which in turn has indirect ramifications on
the overall 5G system. We will identify and explain these
ramifications in later chapters.</p>
<h2 id="access-networks">Access Networks</h2>
<p>The cellular network is part of the access network that implements the
Internet&#x2019;s so-called <em>last mile</em>. Other access technologies include
<em>Passive Optical Networks (PON)</em>, colloquially known as
Fiber-to-the-Home. These access networks are provided by both big and
small network operators. Global network operators like AT&amp;T run access
networks at thousands of points-of-presence across a country like the
US, along with a national backbone that interconnects those
sites. Small regional and municipal network operators might run an
access network with one or two points-of-presence, and then connect to
the rest of the Internet through some large operator&#x2019;s backbone.</p>
<p>In either case, access networks are physically anchored at thousands
of points-of-presence within close proximity to end users, each of
which serves anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000 subscribers, depending on
population density. In practice, the physical deployment of these
&#x201D;edge&#x201D; locations vary from operator to operator, but one possible
scenario is to anchor both the cellular and wireline access networks
in Telco <em>Central Offices</em>.</p>
<p>Historically, the Central Office&#x2014;officially known as the <em>PSTN
(Packet-Switched Telephone Network) Central Office</em>&#x2014;anchored wired
access (both telephony and broadband), while the cellular network
evolved independently by deploying a parallel set of <em>Mobile Telephone
Switching Offices (MTSO)</em>. Each MTSO serves as a <em>mobile aggregation</em>
point for the set of cell towers in a given geographic area. For our
purposes, the important idea is that such aggregation points exist,
and it is reasonable to think of them as defining the edge of the
operator-managed access network. For simplicity, we sometimes use the
term &#x201C;Central Office&#x201D; as a synonym for both types of edge sites.</p>
<p>Note that in addition to these edge locations, there are also
centralized components of the cellular network that track subscribers
as they move from one location to another, but each individual access
network site is limited in size due to the technology it employs. For
example, PON and RAN both have a maximum reach measured in a few
kilometers.</p>
<h2 id="edge-cloud">Edge Cloud</h2>
<p>Because of their wide distribution and close proximity to end users,
Central Offices are also an ideal place to host the edge cloud. But
this begs the question: What exactly is the edge cloud?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the cloud began as a collection of warehouse-sized
datacenters, each of which provided a cost-effective way to power,
cool, and operate a scalable number of servers. Over time, this shared
infrastructure lowered the barrier to deploying scalable Internet
services, but today, there is increasing pressure to offer
low-latency/high-bandwidth cloud applications that cannot be
effectively implemented in centralized datacenters. Augmented Reality
(AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Autonomous
Vehicles are all examples of this kind of application. This has
resulted in a trend to move some functionality out of the datacenter
and towards the edge of the network, closer to end users.</p>
<p>Where this edge is <em>physically</em> located depends on who you ask. If you
ask a network operator that already owns and operates thousands of
Central Offices, then their Central Offices are an obvious
answer. Others might claim the edge is located at the 14,000 Starbucks
across the US, and still others might point to the tens-of-thousands
of cell towers spread across the globe.</p>
<p>Our approach is to be location agnostic, but it is worth pointing out
that the cloud&#x2019;s migration to the edge coincides with a second trend,
which is that network operators are re-architecting the access network
to use the same commodity hardware and best practices in building
scalable software as the cloud providers. Such a design, which is
sometimes referred to as <em>CORD (Central Office Re-architected as a
Datacenter)</em>, supports both the access network and edge services
co-located on a shared cloud platform. This platform is then
replicated across hundreds or thousands of sites (including, but not
limited to, Central Offices). So while we shouldn&#x2019;t limit ourselves to
the Central Office as the only answer to the question of where the
edge cloud is located, it is becoming a viable option.</p>
<p>When we get into the details of how 5G can be implemented in practice,
we use CORD as our exemplar. For now, the important thing to
understand is that 5G is being implemented as software running on
commodity hardware, rather than embedded in the special-purpose
proprietary hardware used in past generations. This has a significant
impact on how we think about 5G (and how we describes 5G), which will
increasingly become yet another software-based component in the cloud,
as opposed to an isolated and specialized technology attached to the
periphery of the cloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our use of CORD as an exemplar is not to imply that the edge cloud is
limited to Central Offices. CORD is a good exemplar because it is
designed to host both edge services and access technologies like 5G on
a common platform, where the Telco Central Office is one possible
location to deploy such a platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important takeaway from this discussion is that to understand how
5G is being implemented, it is helpful to have a working understanding
of how clouds are built. This includes the use of <em>commodity hardware</em>
(both servers and white-box switches), horizontally scalable
<em>microservices</em> (also referred to as <em>cloud native</em>), and
<em>Software-Defined Networks (SDN)</em>. is also helpful to have an
appreciation for how cloud software is developed, tested, deployed and
operated, including practices like <em>DevOps</em> and <em>Continuous
Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</em>.</p>
<p>One final note about terminology. Anyone that has been paying
attention to the discussion surrounding 5G will have undoubtedly heard
about <em>Network Function Virtualization (NFV)</em>, which involves moving
functionality that was once embedded in hardware appliances into VMs
running on a commodity server. In our experience, NFV is a stepping
stone towards the fully disaggregated solution we describe, and so we
do not dwell on it. You can think of NFV as an alternative to the
cloud native exemplar presented here.</p>
