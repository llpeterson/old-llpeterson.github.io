Chapter 4:  RAN Internals
=========================

The description of the RAN in the previous chapter focused on
functionality, but was mostly silent about the RAN’s internals
structure. We now focus in on some of the internal details, and in doing
so, explain how the RAN is being transformed in 5G. This involves first
describing the stages in the packet processing pipeline, and then
showing how these stages can be distributed and implemented.

4.1 Packet Processing Pipeline
------------------------------

:numref:`Figure %s <fig-pipeline>` shows the packet processing stages
implemented by the base station. These stages are specified by the 3GPP
standard. Note that the figure depicts the base station as a pipeline
(running left-to-right) but it is equally valid to view it as a protocol
stack (as is typically done in official 3GPP documents). Also note that
(for now) we are agnostic as to how these stages are implemented, but
since we are ultimately heading towards a cloud-based implementation,
you can think of each as corresponding to a microservice (if that is
helpful).

.. _fig-pipeline:
.. figure:: figures/Slide14.png 
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
	    
    RAN processing pipeline, including both user and
    control plane components.

The key stages are as follows:

-  RRC (Radio Resource Control) → Responsible for configuring the
   coarse-grain and policy-related aspects of the pipeline. The RRC runs
   in the RAN’s control plane; it does not process packets on the user
   plane.

-  PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) → Responsible for compressing
   and decompressing IP headers, ciphering and integrity protection, and
   making an “early” forwarding decision (i.e., whether to send the
   packet down the pipeline to the UE or forward it to another base
   station).

-  RLC (Radio Link Control) → Responsible for segmentation and
   reassembly, including reliably transmitting/receiving segments by
   implementing ARQ.

-  MAC (Media Access Control) → Responsible for buffering, multiplexing
   and demultiplexing segments, including all real-time scheduling
   decisions about what segments are transmitted when. Also able to make
   a “late” forwarding decision (i.e., to alternative carrier
   frequencies, including Wi-Fi).

-  PHY (Physical Layer) → Responsible for coding and modulation (as
   discussed in an earlier chapter), including FEC.

The last two stages in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-pipeline>` (D/A
conversion and the RF front-end) are beyond the scope of this book.

While it is simplest to view the stages in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-pipeline>`
as a pure left-to-right pipeline, in practice the Scheduler running in the
MAC stage implements the “main loop” for outbound traffic, reading data
from the upstream RLC and scheduling transmissions to the downstream
PHY. In particular, since the Scheduler determines the number of bytes
to transmit to a given UE during each time period (based on all the
factors outlined in an earlier chapter), it must request (get) a segment
of that length from the upstream queue. In practice, the size of the
segment that can be transmitted on behalf of a single UE during a single
scheduling interval can range from a few bytes to an entire IP packet.

4.2 Split RAN
-------------

The next step is understanding how the functionality outlined above is
partitioned between physical elements, and hence, “split” across
centralized and distributed locations. Although the 3GPP standard allows
for multiple split-points, the partition shown in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-split-ran>`
is the one being actively pursued by the
operator-led O-RAN (Open RAN) Alliance. It is the split we adopt
throughout the rest of this book.

.. _fig-split-ran:
.. figure:: figures/Slide15.png 
    :width: 600px
    :align: center

    Split-RAN processing pipeline distributed across a
    Central Unit (CU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Radio Unit (RU).

This results in a RAN-wide configuration similar to that shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-ran-hierarchy>`, where a single *Central Unit (CU)*
running in the cloud serves multiple *Distributed Units (DUs)*, each of
which in turn serves multiple *Radio Units (RUs)*. Critically, the RRC
(centralized in the CU) is responsible for only near-real time
configuration and control decision making, while the Scheduler that is
part of the MAC stage is responsible for all real-time scheduling
decisions.

.. _fig-ran-hierarchy:
.. figure:: figures/Slide16.png 
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
	    
    Split-RAN hierarchy, with one CU serving multiple DUs,
    each of which serves multiple RUs.

Clearly, a DU needs to be “near” (within 1ms) the RUs it manages since
the MAC schedules the radio in real-time. One familiar configuration is
to co-locate a DU and an RU in a cell tower. But when an RU corresponds
to a small cell, many of which might be spread across a modestly sized
geographic area (e.g., a mall, campus, or factory), then a single DU
would likely service multiple RUs. The use of mmWave in 5G is likely to
make this later configuration all the more common.

Also note that the split-RAN changes the nature of the Backhaul Network,
which in 4G connected the base stations (eNBs) back to the Mobile Core.
With the split-RAN there are multiple connections, which are officially
labelled as follows:

-  RU-DU connectivity is called the Fronthaul
-  DU-CU connectivity is called the Midhaul
-  CU-Mobile Core connectivity is called the Backhaul

As we will see in a later chapter, one possible deployment co-locates
the CU and Mobile Core in the same cluster, meaning the backhaul is
implemented in the cluster switching fabric. In such a configuration,
the midhaul then effectively serves the same purpose as the original
backhaul, and the fronthaul is constrained by the
predictable/low-latency requirements of the MAC stage’s real-time
scheduler.

4.3 Software-Defined RAN
------------------------

Finally, we describe how the RAN is implemented according to SDN
principles, resulting in an SD-RAN. The key architectural insight is
shown in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-rrc-split>`, where the RRC from
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-pipeline>` is partitioned into two
sub-components: the one on the left provides a 3GPP-compliant way for
the RAN to interface to the Mobile Core’s control plane, while the one
on the right opens a new programmatic API for exerting software-based
control over the pipeline that implements the RAN user plane.

To be more specific, the left sub-component simply forwards control
packets between the Mobile Core and the PDCP, providing a path over
which the Mobile Core can communicate with the UE for control
purposes, whereas the right sub-component implements the core of the
RCC’s control functionality. This component is commonly referred to as
as the *RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC)* in O-RAN architecture
documents, so we adopt this terminology.  The "Near-Real Time"
qualifier indicates the RIC is part of 10-100ms control loop implemented
in the CU, as opposed to the ~1ms control loop required by the MAC
scheduler running in the DU.

.. _fig-rrc-split:
.. figure:: figures/Slide18.png 
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
	    
    RRC disaggregated into a Mobile Core facing control
    plane component and a Near Real-Time Controller.

Although not shown in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-rrc-split>`, keep in mind
(from :numref:`Figure %s <fig-split-ran>`) that all constituent parts of
the RRC, plus the PDCP, form the CU.

Completing the picture, :numref:`Figure %s <fig-ran-controller>` shows
the Near-RT RIC implemented as a traditional SDN Controller hosting a
set of SDN control apps. The RIC maintains a *RAN Network Information
Base (R-NIB)* that includes time-averaged CQI values and other
per-session state (e.g., GTP tunnel IDs, QCI values for the type of
traffic), while the MAC (as part of the DU) maintains the
instantaneous CQI values required by the real-time
scheduler. Specifically, the R-NIB includes the following state:

-  NODES: Base Stations and Mobile Devices

   -  Base Station Attributes:

      -  Identifiers
      -  Version
      -  Config Report
      -  RRM config
      -  PHY resource usage

   -  Mobile Device Attributes:

      -  Identifiers
      -  Capability
      -  Measurement Config
      -  State (Active/Idle)

-  LINKS: *Actual* between two nodes and *Potential* between UEs and all
   neighbor cells

   -  Link Attributes:

      -  Identifiers
      -  Link Type
      -  Config / Bearer Parameters
      -  QCI Value

-  SLICES: Virtualized RAN Construct

   -  Slice Attributes:

      -  Links
      -  Bearers / Flows
      -  Validity Period
      -  Desired KPIs
      -  MAC RRM Configuration
      -  RRM Control Configuration

.. _fig-ran-controller:

    :width: 500px
    :align: center
	    
    Example set of control applications running on top of
    Near Real-Time RAN Controller.

The example Control Apps in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-ran-controller>`
include a range of possibilities, but is not intended to be an
exhaustive list.  The right-most example, RAN Slicing, is the most
ambitious in that it introduces a new capability: Virtualizing the
RAN. It is also an idea that has been implemented, which we describe
in more detail in the next chapter.

The next three (RF Configuration, Semi-Persistent Scheduling, Cipher Key
Assignment) are examples of configuration-oriented applications. They
provide a programmatic way to manage seldom-changing configuration
state, thereby enabling zero-touch operations. Coming up with meaningful
policies (perhaps driven by analytics) is likely to be an avenue for
innovation in the future.

The left-most four example Control Applications are the sweet spot for
SDN. These functions—Link Aggregation Control, Interference
Management, Load Balancing, and Handover Control—are currently
implemented by individual base stations with only local visibility,
but they have global consequenes. The SDN approach is to collect the
available input data centrally, make a globally optimal decision, and
then push the respective control parametes back to the base stations
for execution. Realizing this value in the RAN is still a
work-in-progress, but evidence using the same approach to optimize
wide-are networks is compelling.

   to a production network, we recommend `B4: Experience with a

We conclude this introduction to SD-RAN with a reminder that all the
disaggregation and softwarization discussed in this chapter is being
pursued in the context of the 3GPP standard. SD-RAN is an
implementation choice, and the result is intended to be
3GPP-compliant. This means that 3GPP-defined interfaces still apply to
inter-module communication, and while we do not focus on the details
of those interfaces in this book, it is good to be aware that those
interfaces exist. :numref:`Figure %s <fig-3gpp>` shows those
interfaces overlayed on the disaggregated components introduced
throughout this chapter.

.. _fig-3gpp:
.. figure:: figures/Slide38.png 
    :width: 450px
    :align: center
	    
    Split-RAN plus SD-RAN annotated with 3GPP-defined interfaces.

The interface names are cryptic, but easily summarized. The mobile
operator's management plane—typically called the *OSS (Operations
Support System)* in the Telco world—uses the **A1** interface to
configure the RAN; the Near-RT RIC uses the **E2** interface to
control the underlying RAN elements (both legacy eNodeBs and the set
of Split-RAN elements); the CU's Control Plane (CU-C) uses the **E1**
interface to control the CU's User Plane (CU-U); the CU-C/CU-U
combination uses the **F1-C/F1-U** interface-pair to communicate with
the DU; and the **Fronthaul** described in Section 4.2 connects the DU
to the RU.

Note that we have not discussed the Telco OSS up to this point, but it
always assumed to be at the top of any Telco software stack. Also note
that there is no prescribed interface between the SDN Control
Applications and the RIC. This is because separating the RIC platform
from the RIC control apps is an implementation choice; O-RAN
architecture documents treat the applications as part of the
RIC. Calling them out separately foreshadows the implementation
described in Chapter 6.

Knowing these interface names adds nothing to our conceptual
understanding of the RAN, except perhaps to re-enforce how challenging
it is to introduce a transformative technology like Software-Defined
Networking into an operational environment that is striving to acheive
full backward compatibility and universal interoperability. It is
instructive to contrast this approach with the Internet's philosophy
of trying to minimize the universally agreed upon definitions.

Finally, we recommend that you match-up the elements in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-3gpp>` with those described earlier in this
chapter. But as you do so, you won't find an explicit Central Unit
Control Plane (CU-C) and Central Unit User Plane (CU-U) in the earlier
diagrams. They are there, but by different names (e.g., the PDCP
module corresponds to the CU-U). There is more to say on this topic,
which we take up in the next chapter.
