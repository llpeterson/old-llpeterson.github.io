<h1>Chapter 7:  Cloudification of Access<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-7-cloudification-of-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The previous chapters went step-by-step, first breaking 5G down into its
elemental components and then showing how those components could be put
back together using best practices in cloud design to build a fully
functional, 3GPP-compliant 5G cellular network. In doing so, it is easy
to lose sight of the big picture, which is that the cellular network is
undergoing a dramatic transformation. That’s the whole point of 5G. We
conclude by making some observations about this big picture.</p>
<div class="section" id="multi-cloud">
<h2>7.1 Multi-Cloud<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-cloud" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To understand the impact of cloud technologies and practices being
applied to the access network, it is helpful to first understand what’s
important about the cloud. The cloud has fundamentally changed the way
we compute, and more importantly, the pace of innovation. It has done
this through a combination of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Disaggregation:</strong> Breaking vertically integrated systems into
independent components with open interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> Being able to run multiple independent copies of
those components on a common hardware platform.</li>
<li><strong>Commoditization:</strong> Being able to elastically scale those virtual
components across commodity hardware bricks as workload dictates.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an opportunity for the same to happen with the access network,
or from another perspective, for the cloud to essentially expand so far
as to subsume the access network.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-cloud"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide32.png"><img alt="_images/Slide32.png" src="_images/Slide32.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 32. </span><span class="caption-text">A multi-tenant / multi-cloud—including virtualized RAN
resources alongside conventional compute, storage, and network
resources—hosting both Telco and Over-the-Top (OTT) services and
applications.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-cloud"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 32</span></a> gives a high-level overview of how the
transformation might play out, with the global cloud spanning edge
clouds, private Telco clouds, and the familiar public clouds. Each
individual cloud site is potentially owned by a different organization
(this includes the cell towers, as well), and as a consequence, each
site will likely be multi-tenant in that it is able to host (and
isolate) applications on behalf of many other people and organizations.
Those applications, in turn, will include a combination of the RAN and
Core services (as described throughout this book), Over-the-Top (OTT)
applications commonly found today in public clouds (but now also
distributed across edge clouds), and new Telco-managed applications
(also distributed across centralized and edge locations).</p>
<p>Eventually, we can expect common APIs to emerge, lowering the barrier
for anyone (not just today’s network operators or cloud providers) to
deploy applications across multiple sites by acquiring the storage,
compute, networking, and connectivity resources they need.</p>

<h2>7.2 Research Opportunities<a class="headerlink" href="#research-opportunities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order for the scenario depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-cloud"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 32</span></a>
to become a reality, a wealth of research problems need to be
addressed, many of which are a consequence of the blurring line
between access networks and the edge cloud. We refer to this as the
<em>access-edge</em>, and we conclude by identifying some example
challenges/opportunities.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Multi-Access:</strong> The access-edge will need to support multiple
access technologies (e.g., WiFi, 5G, fiber), and allow users to
seamlessly move between them. Research is needed to break down
existing technology silos, and design converged solutions to common
problems (e.g., security, mobility, QoS).</li>
<li><strong>Heterogeneity:</strong> Since the access-edge will be about low-latency
and high-bandwidth connectivity, much edge functionality will be
implemented by programming the forwarding pipeline in white-box
switches, and more generally, will use other domain-specific
processors (e.g., GPUs, TPUs). Research is needed to tailor edge
services to take advantage of heterogeneous resources, as well as
how to construct end-to-end applications from such a collection of
building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> The access-edge will virtualize the underlying
hardware using a range of techniques, from VMs to containers to
lambdas, interconnected by a range of L2, L3, and L4/7 virtual
networks, some of which will be managed by SDN control
applications. Research is needed to reconcile the assumptions made
about by cloud native services and access-oriented Virtualized
Network Functions (VNFs) about how to virtualize compute, storage,
and networking resources.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Tenancy:</strong> The access-edge will be multi-tenant, with
potentially different stakeholders (operators, service providers,
application developers, enterprises) responsible for managing
different components. It will not be feasible to run the entire
access-edge in a single trust domain, as different components will
operate with different levels of autonomy. Research is needed to
minimize the overhead isolation imposed on tenants.</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong> Monetizing the access-edge will require the
ability to offer differentiated and customized services to different
classes of subscribers/applications. Sometimes called network
slicing, this involves support for performance isolation at the
granularity of service chains—the sequence of functional elements
running on behalf of some subscriber. Research is needed to enforce
performance isolation in support of service guarantees.</li>
<li><strong>Near-Real Time:</strong> The access-edge will be a highly dynamic
environment, with functionality constantly adapting in response to
mobility, workload, and application requirements. Supporting such an
environment requires tight control loops, with control software
running at the edge. Research is needed to analyze control loops,
define analytic-based controllers, and design dynamically adaptable
mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Data Reduction:</strong> The access-edge will connect an increasing
number of devices (not just humans and their handsets), all of which
are capable of generating data. Supporting data reduction will be
critical, which implies the need for substantial compute capacity
(likely including domain-specific processors) to be available in the
access-edge. Research is needed to refactor applications into their
edge-reduction/backend-analysis subcomponents.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Services:</strong> Services will become inherently
distributed, with some aspects running at the access-edge, some
aspects running in the datacenter, and some running on premises or
end device (e.g., on-vehicle). Supporting such an environment
requires a multi-cloud solution that is decoupled from any single
infrastructure-based platform, with research needed to develop
heuristics for function placement.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The access-edge will potentially span thousands or
even tens of thousands of edge sites. Scaling up the ability to
remotely orchestrate that many edge sites (even at just the
infrastructure level) will be a qualitatively different challenge
than managing a single datacenter. Research is need to scale both
the edge platform and widely deployed edge services.</li>
