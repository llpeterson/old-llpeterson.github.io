<p>For anyone familiar with wireless access technologies like Wi-Fi, the
cellular network is most unique due to its approach to sharing the
available radio spectrum among its many users, all the while allowing
those users to remain connected while moving. This has resulted in a
highly dynamic and adaptive approach, in which coding, modulation and
scheduling play a central role.</p>
<p>As we will see later in this chapter, cellular networks use a
reservation-based strategy, whereas Wi-Fi is contention-based. This
difference is rooted in each system&#x2019;s fundamental assumption about
utilization: Wi-Fi assumes a lightly loaded network (and hence
optimistically transmits when the wireless link is idle and backs off
if contention is detected), while 4G and 5G cellular networks assume
(and strive for) high utilization (and hence explicitly assign
different users to different &#x201C;shares&#x201D; of the available radio
spectrum).</p>
<p>We start by giving short primer on radio transmission as a way of
laying a foundation for understanding the rest of the 5G
architecture. The following is not a substitute for a theoretical
treatment of the topic, but is instead intended as a way of grounding
the systems-oriented description of 5G that follows in the reality of
wireless communication.</p>
<h2 id="coding-and-modulation">Coding and Modulation</h2>
<p>At its core, coding inserts extra bits into the data to account for
environmental factors that interfere with signal propagation, and
modulation translates the encoded data into electromagnetic signals by
varying the signal&#x2019;s amplitude and phase. This relationship is
depicted in <a href="#modulation">Figure 2.1</a>, where coding typically implies
some form of <em>Forward Error Correction</em> (e.g., turbo codes, polar
codes) and modulation is done relative to an assigned <em>carrier
signal</em>.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 2.1: The role of coding and modulation in wireless
    communication.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When dealing with radio signals propagating through the air,
opportunities for interference abound. As illustrated in
<a href="#multipath">Figure 2.2</a>, the signal bounces off various stationary
and moving objects, following multiple paths from the transmitter to
the receiver, who may also be moving.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 2.2: Signals propagate along multiple paths from
    transmitter to receiver.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a consequence of these multiple paths, the original signal arrives
at the receiver spread over time, as illustrated in
<a href="#coherence">Figure 2.3</a>. Empirical evidence shows that the Multipath
Spread&#x2014;the time between the first and last signals of one transmission
arriving at the receiver&#x2014;is 1 to 10&#x3BC;s in urban environments and 10 to
30&#x3BC;s in suburban environments. Theoretical bounds for the time
duration for which the channel may be assumed to be time invariant,
known as the Coherence Time and denoted <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T_c</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist"><span style="top:0.15em;margin-right:0.05em;margin-left:-0.13889em;"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">&#x200B;</span></span><span class="reset-textstyle scriptstyle cramped mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">c</span></span></span><span class="baseline-fix"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">&#x200B;</span></span>&#x200B;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> , is given by</p>

time is inversely proportional to the frequency of the signal and the
speed of movement, which makes intuitive sense: The higher the
frequency (narrower the wave) the shorter the coherence time, and
likewise, the faster the receiver is moving the longer the coherence
time. Based on the target parameters to this model (selected according
to the target physical environment), it is possible to calculate <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T_c</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist"><span style="top:0.15em;margin-right:0.05em;margin-left:-0.13889em;"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">&#x200B;</span></span><span class="reset-textstyle scriptstyle cramped mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">c</span></span></span><span class="baseline-fix"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">&#x200B;</span></span>&#x200B;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
which in turn bounds the rate at which symbols can be transmitted
without undue risk of interference.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 2.3: Received data spread over time due to multipath
    variation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To complicate matters further, <a href="#multipath">Figures 2.2</a> and
<a href="#coherence">2.3</a> imply the transmission originates from a single
antenna, but cell towers are equipped with an array of antennas, each
transmitting in a different (but overlapping) direction. This
technology, called <em>Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO)</em>, opens the
door to purposely transmitting data from multiple antennas in an
effort to reach the receiver, adding even more paths to the
environment-imposed multipath propagation.</p>
<p>One of the most important consequences of these factors is that the
transmitter must receive feedback from every receiver to judge how to
best utilize the wireless medium on their behalf. 3GPP specifies a
<em>Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)</em> for this purpose, where in practice
the receiver sends a CQI status report to the base station
periodically (e.g., every millisecond). These CQI messages report the
observed signal-to-noise ratio, which impacts the receiver&#x2019;s ability
to recover the data bits. The base station then uses this information
to adapt how it allocates the available radio spectrum to the
subscribers it is serving. This allocation decision is the job of the
scheduler.</p>
<p>How the scheduler does its job is one of the most important properties
of each generation of the cellular network, which in turn depends on
the multiplexing mechanism. For example, 2G used <em>Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA)</em> and 3G used <em>Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA)</em>. It is also a major differentiator for 4G and 5G, completing
the transition from the cellular network being fundamentally
circuit-switched to fundamentally packet-switched. The following two
sections describe each, in turn.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling-4g">Scheduling: 4G</h2>
<p>The state-of-the-art in multiplexing 4G cellular networks is called
<em>Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)</em>. The idea is
to multiplex data over a set of 12 orthogonal subcarrier frequencies,
each of which is modulated independently. The &#x201C;Multiple Access&#x201D; in
OFDMA implies that data can simultaneously be sent on behalf of
multiple users, each on a different subcarrier frequency and for a
different duration of time. The subbands are narrow (e.g., 15kHz), but
the coding of user data into OFDMA symbols is designed to minimize the
risk of data loss due to interference between adjacent bands.</p>
<p>The use of OFDMA naturally leads to conceptualizing the radio spectrum
as a two-dimensional resource, as shown in
<a href="#sched-grid">Figure 2.4</a>. The minimal schedulable unit, called a
<em>Resource Element (RE)</em>, corresponds to a 15kHz-wide band around one
subcarrier frequency and the time it takes to transmit one OFDMA
symbol. The number of bits that can be encoded in each symbol depends
on the modulation rate, so for example using <em>Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation (QAM)</em>, 16-QAM yields 4 bits per symbol and 64-QAM yields
16 bits per symbol</p>
<figure>
    <a id="sched-grid"></a>
    <img src="figures/Slide12.png" width="600px">
    <figcaption>Figure 2.4: Spectrum abstractly represented by a 2-D grid of
    schedulable Resource Elements.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A scheduler allocates some number of REs to each user that has data to
transmit during each 1ms <em>Transmission Time Interval (TTI</em>, where
users are depicted by different colored blocks in Figure 4. The only
constraint on the scheduler is that it must make its allocation
decisions on blocks of 7x12=84 resource elements, called a <em>Physical
Resource Block (PRB)</em>. <a href="#sched-grid">Figure 2.4</a> shows two
back-to-back PRBs. Of course time continues to flow along one axis,
and depending on the size of the available frequency band (e.g., it
might be 100MHz wide), there may be many more subcarrier slots (and
hence PRBs) available along the other axis, so the scheduler is
essentially preparing and transmitting a sequence of PRBs.</p>
<p>Note that OFDMA is not a coding/modulation algorithm, but instead
provides a framework for selecting a specific coding and modulator for
each subcarrier frequency. QAM is one common example modulator. It is
the scheduler&#x2019;s responsibility to select the modulation to use for
each PRB, based on the CQI feedback it has received. The scheduler
also selects the coding on a per-PRB basis, for example, by how it
sets the parameters to the turbo code algorithm.</p>
<p>The 1ms TTI corresponds to the time frame in which the scheduler
receives feedback from users about the quality of the signal they are
experiencing. This is the CQI mentioned earlier, where once every
millisecond, each user sends a set of metrics, which the scheduler
uses to make its decision as to how to allocate PRBs during the
subsequent TTI.</p>
<p>Another input to the scheduling decision is the <em>QoS Class Identifier
(QCI)</em>, which indicates the quality-of-service each class of traffic
is to receive. In 4G, the QCI value assigned to each class (there are
nine such classes, in total) indicates whether the traffic has a
<em>Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR)</em> or not <em>(non-GBR)</em>, plus the class&#x2019;s
relative priority within those two categories.</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that <a href="#sched-grid">Figure 2.4</a> focuses on
scheduling transmissions from a single antenna, but the MIMO
technology described above means the scheduler also has to determine
which antenna (or more generally, what subset of antennas) will most
effectively reach each receiver. But again, in the abstract, the
scheduler is charged with allocating a sequence of Resource Elements.</p>
<p>This all begs the question: How does the scheduler decide which set of
users to service during a given time interval, how many resource
elements to allocate to each such user, how to select the coding and
modulation levels, and which antenna to transmit their data on? This
is an optimization problem that, fortunately, we are not trying to
solve here. Our goal is to describe an architecture that allows
someone else to design and plug in an effective scheduler. Keeping the
cellular architecture open to innovations like this is one of our
goals, and as we will see in the next section, becomes even more
important in 5G where the scheduler operates with even more degrees of
freedom.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling-5g">Scheduling: 5G</h2>
<p>The transition from 4G to 5G introduces additional degrees-of-freedom
in how the radio spectrum is scheduled, making it possible to adapt
the cellular network to a more diverse set of devices and applications
domains.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, 5G defines a family of waveforms&#x2014;unlike LTE, which
specified only one waveform&#x2014;each optimized for a different band in the
radio spectrum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A waveform is the frequency, amplitude, and phase-shift independent
property (shape) of a signal. A sine wave is an example waveform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bands with carrier frequencies below 1GHz
are designed to deliver mobile broadband and massive IoT services with
a primary focus on range. Carrier frequencies between 1GHz-6GHz are
designed to offer wider bandwidths, focusing on mobile broadband and
mission-critical applications. Carrier frequencies above 24GHz
(mmWaves) are designed to provide super wide bandwidths over short,
line-of-sight coverage.</p>
<p>These different waveforms affect the scheduling and subcarrier
intervals (i.e., the &#x201C;size&#x201D; of the resource elements described in the
previous section).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For sub-1GHz bands, 5G allows maximum 50MHz bandwidths. In this
case, there are two waveforms: one with subcarrier spacing of 15kHz
and another of 30kHz. (We used 15kHz in the example shown in
<a href="#sched-grid">Figure 2.4</a>.) The corresponding scheduling intervals
are 0.5ms and 0.25ms, respectively. (We used 0.5ms in the example
shown in <a href="#sched-grid">Figure 2.4</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>For 1GHz-6GHz bands, maximum bandwidths go up to
100MHz. Correspondingly, there are three waveforms with subcarrier
spacings of 15kHz, 30kHz and 60kHz, corresponding to scheduling
intervals of 0.5ms, 0.25ms and 0.125ms, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For millimeter bands, bandwidths may go up to 400MHz. There are two
waveforms, with subcarrier spacings of 60kHz and 120kHz. Both have
scheduling intervals of 0.125ms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This range of options is important because it adds another degree of
freedom to the scheduler. In addition to allocating radio resources to
users, it has the ability to dynamically adjust the size of the
resource by changing the wave form being used. With this additional
freedom, fixed-sized REs are no longer the primary unit of resource
allocation. We instead use more abstract terminology, and talk about
allocating <em>Resource Blocks</em> to subscribers, where the 5G scheduler
determines both the size and number of Resource Blocks allocated
during each time interval.</p>
<p><a href="#scheduler">Figure 2.5</a> depicts the role of the scheduler from this
more abstract perspective, where just as with 4G, CQI feedback from
the receivers and the QCI quality-of-service class selected by the
subscriber are the two key pieces of input to the scheduler. Note that
the set of QCI values changes between 4G and 5G, reflecting the
increasing differentiation being supported. For 5G, each class
includes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Type: Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR), Delay-Critical GBR, Non-GBR</li>
<li>Priority Level    </li>
<li>Packet Delay Budget    </li>
<li>Packet Error Rate    </li>
<li>Averaging Window    </li>
<li>Maximum Data Burst</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while the preceding discussion could be interpreted to imply
a one-to-one relationship between subscribers and a QCI, it is more
accurate to say that each QCI is associated with a class of traffic
(often corresponding to some type of application), where a given
subscriber might be sending and receiving traffic that belongs to
multiple classes at any given time. We explore this idea in much more
depth in a later section.</p>
