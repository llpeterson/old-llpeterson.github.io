<h1>Chapter 4:  RAN Internals<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-4-ran-internals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The description of the RAN in the previous chapter focused on
functionality, but was mostly silent about the RAN’s internals
structure. We now focus in on some of the internal details, and in
doing so, explain how the RAN is being transformed in 5G. This
involves first describing the stages in the packet processing
pipeline, and then showing how these stages can be disaggregated,
distributed and implemented.</p>
<p>Our approach in this chapter is to incrementally build the RAN from
the bottom up in the first three sections. Section 4.4 then summarizes
the overall design, with a focus on how the resulting end-to-end
system is architected to evolve.</p>
<div class="section" id="packet-processing-pipeline">
<h2>4.1 Packet Processing Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#packet-processing-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pipeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a> shows the packet processing stages
implemented by the base station. These stages are specified by the 3GPP
standard. Note that the figure depicts the base station as a pipeline
(running left-to-right) but it is equally valid to view it as a protocol
stack (as is typically done in official 3GPP documents). Also note that
(for now) we are agnostic as to how these stages are implemented, but
since we are ultimately heading towards a cloud-based implementation,
you can think of each as corresponding to a microservice (if that is
helpful).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-pipeline"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide14.png"><img alt="_images/Slide14.png" src="_images/Slide14.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 19. </span><span class="caption-text">RAN processing pipeline, including both user and
control plane components.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The key stages are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>RRC (Radio Resource Control) → Responsible for configuring the
coarse-grain and policy-related aspects of the pipeline. The RRC runs
in the RAN’s control plane; it does not process packets on the user
plane.</li>
<li>PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) → Responsible for compressing
and decompressing IP headers, ciphering and integrity protection, and
making an “early” forwarding decision (i.e., whether to send the
packet down the pipeline to the UE or forward it to another base
station).</li>
<li>RLC (Radio Link Control) → Responsible for segmentation and
reassembly, including reliably transmitting/receiving segments by
implementing ARQ.</li>
<li>MAC (Media Access Control) → Responsible for buffering, multiplexing
and demultiplexing segments, including all real-time scheduling
decisions about what segments are transmitted when. Also able to make
a “late” forwarding decision (i.e., to alternative carrier
frequencies, including Wi-Fi).</li>
<li>PHY (Physical Layer) → Responsible for coding and modulation (as
discussed in an earlier chapter), including FEC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two stages in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pipeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a> (D/A
conversion and the RF front-end) are beyond the scope of this book.</p>
<p>While it is simplest to view the stages in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pipeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a>
as a pure left-to-right pipeline, in practice the Scheduler running in the
MAC stage implements the “main loop” for outbound traffic, reading data
from the upstream RLC and scheduling transmissions to the downstream
PHY. In particular, since the Scheduler determines the number of bytes
to transmit to a given UE during each time period (based on all the
factors outlined in an earlier chapter), it must request (get) a segment
of that length from the upstream queue. In practice, the size of the
segment that can be transmitted on behalf of a single UE during a single
scheduling interval can range from a few bytes to an entire IP packet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="split-ran">
<h2>4.2 Split RAN<a class="headerlink" href="#split-ran" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to understand how the functionality outlined above is
partitioned between physical elements, and hence, “split” across
centralized and distributed locations. The dominant option has
historically been “no split,” with the entire pipeline shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pipeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a> running in the base station.  Going
forward, the 3GPP standard has been extended to allow for multiple
split-points, with the partition shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-split-ran"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a> being actively pursued by the operator-led O-RAN
(Open RAN) Alliance. It is the split we adopt throughout the rest of
this book.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig-split-ran"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide15.png"><img alt="_images/Slide15.png" src="_images/Slide15.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 20. </span><span class="caption-text">Split-RAN processing pipeline distributed across a
Central Unit (CU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Radio Unit (RU).</span></p>
</div>
<p>This results in a RAN-wide configuration similar to that shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ran-hierarchy"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 21</span></a>, where a single <em>Central Unit (CU)</em>
running in the cloud serves multiple <em>Distributed Units (DUs)</em>, each of
which in turn serves multiple <em>Radio Units (RUs)</em>. Critically, the RRC
(centralized in the CU) is responsible for only near-real time
configuration and control decision making, while the Scheduler that is
part of the MAC stage is responsible for all real-time scheduling
decisions.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-ran-hierarchy"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide16.png"><img alt="_images/Slide16.png" src="_images/Slide16.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 21. </span><span class="caption-text">Split-RAN hierarchy, with one CU serving multiple DUs,
each of which serves multiple RUs.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Clearly, a DU needs to be “near” (within 1ms) the RUs it manages since
the MAC schedules the radio in real-time. One familiar configuration is
to co-locate a DU and an RU in a cell tower. But when an RU corresponds
to a small cell, many of which might be spread across a modestly sized
geographic area (e.g., a mall, campus, or factory), then a single DU
would likely service multiple RUs. The use of mmWave in 5G is likely to
make this later configuration all the more common.</p>
<p>Also note that the split-RAN changes the nature of the Backhaul Network,
which in 4G connected the base stations (eNBs) back to the Mobile Core.
With the split-RAN there are multiple connections, which are officially
labelled as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>RU-DU connectivity is called the Fronthaul</li>
<li>DU-CU connectivity is called the Midhaul</li>
<li>CU-Mobile Core connectivity is called the Backhaul</li>
</ul>
<p>One observation about the CU (which is relevant in the next chapter)
is that one might co-locate the CU and Mobile Core in the same
cluster, meaning the backhaul is implemented in the cluster switching
fabric. In such a configuration, the midhaul then effectively serves
the same purpose as the original backhaul, and the fronthaul is
constrained by the predictable/low-latency requirements of the MAC
stage’s real-time scheduler.</p>
<p>A second observation about the CU shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-split-ran"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a> is that it encompasses two functional blocks—the RRM
and the PDPC—which lie on the RAN’s control plane and user plane,
respectively. This separation is consistent with the idea of CUPS
introduced in Chapter 3, and plays an increasingly important role as
we dig deeper into how the RAN is implemented. For now, we note that
the two parts are typically referred to as the CU-C and CU-U,
respectively.</p>

<h2>4.3 Software-Defined RAN<a class="headerlink" href="#software-defined-ran" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Finally, we describe how the RAN is implemented according to SDN
principles, resulting in an SD-RAN. The key architectural insight is
shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rrc-split"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 22</span></a>, where the RRC from
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pipeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a> is partitioned into two
sub-components: the one on the left provides a 3GPP-compliant way for
the RAN to interface to the Mobile Core’s control plane, while the one
on the right opens a new programmatic API for exerting software-based
control over the pipeline that implements the RAN user plane.</p>
<p>To be more specific, the left sub-component simply forwards control
packets between the Mobile Core and the PDCP, providing a path over
which the Mobile Core can communicate with the UE for control
purposes, whereas the right sub-component implements the core of the
RCC’s control functionality. This component is commonly referred to as
the <em>RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC)</em> in O-RAN architecture
documents, so we adopt this terminology.  The “Near-Real Time”
qualifier indicates the RIC is part of 10-100ms control loop implemented
in the CU, as opposed to the ~1ms control loop required by the MAC
scheduler running in the DU.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id4">
<span id="fig-rrc-split"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide18.png"><img alt="_images/Slide18.png" src="_images/Slide18.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 22. </span><span class="caption-text">RRC disaggregated into a Mobile Core facing control

</div>
<p>Although not shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rrc-split"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 22</span></a>, keep in mind
(from <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-split-ran"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a>) that all constituent parts of
the RRC, plus the PDCP, form the CU.</p>
<p>Completing the picture, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ran-controller"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 23</span></a> shows
the Near-RT RIC implemented as a traditional SDN Controller hosting a
set of SDN control apps. The RIC maintains a <em>RAN Network Information
Base (R-NIB)</em> that includes time-averaged CQI values and other
per-session state (e.g., GTP tunnel IDs, QCI values for the type of
traffic), while the MAC (as part of the DU) maintains the
instantaneous CQI values required by the real-time
scheduler. Specifically, the R-NIB includes the following state:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 23. </span><span class="caption-text">Example set of control applications running on top of

</div>
<p>The example Control Apps in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ran-controller"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 23</span></a>
include a range of possibilities, but is not intended to be an
exhaustive list.  The right-most example, RAN Slicing, is the most
ambitious in that it introduces a new capability: Virtualizing the
RAN. It is also an idea that has been implemented, which we describe
in more detail in the next chapter.</p>
<p>The next three (RF Configuration, Semi-Persistent Scheduling, Cipher Key
Assignment) are examples of configuration-oriented applications. They
provide a programmatic way to manage seldom-changing configuration
state, thereby enabling zero-touch operations. Coming up with meaningful
policies (perhaps driven by analytics) is likely to be an avenue for
innovation in the future.</p>
<p>The left-most four example Control Applications are the sweet spot for
SDN. These functions—Link Aggregation Control, Interference
Management, Load Balancing, and Handover Control—are currently
implemented by individual base stations with only local visibility,
but they have global consequenes. The SDN approach is to collect the
available input data centrally, make a globally optimal decision, and
then push the respective control parametes back to the base stations
for execution. Realizing this value in the RAN is still a
work-in-progress, but evidence using the same approach to optimize
wide-area networks is compelling.</p>
<p>While we have loosely categorized the space of potential control apps
as either config-oriented or control-oriented, another possible
characterization is based on the current practice of controling the
mobile link at two different levels. At a fine-grain level, per-node
and per-link control is conducted using Radio Resource Management
(RRM) functions that are distributed across the individual base
stations.  RRM functions include scheduling, handover control, link
and carrier aggregation control, bearer control, and access control.
At a coarse-grain level, regional mobile network optimization and
configuration is conducted using <em>Self-Organizing Network (SON)</em>
functions. These functions oversee neighbor lists, manage load
balancing, optimize coverage and capacity, aim for network-wide
interference mitigation, centrally configure parameters, and so on. As
a consequence of these two levels of control, it is not uncommon to
see reference to <em>RRM Applications</em> and <em>SON Applications</em> in the
context of SD-RAN.</p>

<h2>4.4 Design for Evolution<a class="headerlink" href="#design-for-evolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We conclude this description of RAN internals by re-visiting the
step-by-step process of disaggregation, which as the previous three
sections revealed, is being pursued in multiple tiers. In doing so, we
tie up several loose ends, including the new interfaces disaggregation
exposes, around which the 5G RAN is architected to evolve.</p>
<p>In the first tier of disaggregation, 3GPP standards provide multiple
options of how horizontal RAN splits can take place. Horizontal
disaggregation basically splits the RAN pipeline shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pipeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a> into independently operating
components.  <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-disagg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 24 (a)</span></a> illustrates
horizontal disaggregation of the RAN froma single base station into
three distinct components: CU, DU and RU. The O-RAN Alliance has
selected specific disaggregation options from 3GPP and is developing
open interfaces between these components.  3GPP defines the <strong>N2</strong> and
<strong>N3</strong> interfaces between the RAN and the Mobile Core.</p>
<p>The second tier of disaggregation is vertical, focusing on
control/user plane separation (CUPS) of the CU, and resulting in CU-U
and CU-C shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-disagg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 24 (b)</span></a>. The control
plane in question is the 3GPP control plane, where the CU-U realizes a
pipeline for user traffic and the CU-C focuses on control message
signaling between Mobile Core and the disaggregated RAN components (as
well as to the UE). The O-RAN specified interfaces between these
disaggregated components are also shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-disagg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 24 (b)</span></a>.</p>
<p>The third tier follows the SDN paradigm by carrying vertical
disaggregation one step further. It does this by separating most of
RAN control (RRM functions) from the disaggregated RAN components, and
logically centralizing them as applications running on an SDN
Controller, which corresponds to the Near-RT RIC shown previously in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rrc-split"><span class="std std-numref">Figures 22</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ran-controller"><span class="std std-numref">Figures 23</span></a>. This SDN-based vertical disaggregation is
repeated here in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-disagg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 24 (c)</span></a>.  The figure
also shows the additional O-RAN prescribed interfaces.</p>

<p>The interface names are cryptic, and knowing their details adds little
to our conceptual understanding of the RAN, except perhaps to
re-enforce how challenging it is to introduce a transformative
technology like Software-Defined Networking into an operational
environment that is striving to achieve full backward compatibility
and universal interoperability. That said, we call out two notable
examples.</p>
<p>The first is the <strong>A1</strong> interface that the mobile operator’s
management plane—typically called the <em>OSS/BSS (Operations Support
System / Business Support System)</em> in the Telco world—uses the to
configure the RAN.  We have not discussed the Telco OSS/BSS up to this
point, but it safe to assume such a component sits at the top of any
Telco software stack. It is the source of all configuration settings
and business logic needed to operate a network. Notice that the
Management Plane shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-disagg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 24 (c)</span></a>
includes a <em>Non-Real TIme RIC</em> functional block, complementing the
Near-RT RIC that that sits below the A1 interface. We return to the
relevance of these two RICs in a moment.</p>
<p>The second is the <strong>E2</strong> interface that the Near-RT RIC uses to
control the underlying RAN elements. A requirement of the E2 interface
is that it be able to connect the Near-RT RIC to different types of
RAN elements. This range is reflected in the API, which revolves
around a <em>Service Model</em> abstraction. The idea is that each RAN
element advertises a Service Model, which effectively defines the set
of RAN Functions the element is able to support. The RIC then issues a
combination of the following four operations against this Service
Model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Report:</strong> RIC asks the element to report a function-specific value setting.</li>
<li><strong>Insert:</strong> RIC instructs the element to activate a user plane function.</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> RIC instructs the element to activate a control plane function.</li>
<li><strong>Policy:</strong> RIC sets a policy parameter on one of the activated functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it is the RAN element, through its published Service Model,
that defines the relevant set of functions that can be activated, the
variables that can be reported, and policies that can be set.</p>
<p>Taken together, the A1 and E2 interfaces complete two of the three
major control loops of the RAN: the outer (non-realtime) loop has the
Non-RT RIC as it control point and the middle (near-realtime) loop has
the Near-RT RIC as its control point. The third (inner) control loop,
which is not shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-disagg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 24</span></a>, runs inside
the DU: It includes the realtime Scheduler embedded in the MAC stage
of the RAN pipeline. The two outer control loops have rough time
bounds of &gt;&gt;1sec and &gt;10ms, respectively, and as we saw in Chapter 2,
the realtime control loop is assumed by be &lt;1ms.</p>
<p>This raises the question of how specific functionality is distributed
between the Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, and DU. Starting with the second
pair (i.e., the two inner loops), it is important to recognize that
not all RRM functions can be centralized. After horizontal and
vertical CUPS disaggregation, the RRM functions are split between CU-C
and DU. For this reason, the SDN-based vertical disaggregation focuses
on centralizing CU-C-side RRM functions in the Near-RT RIC. In
addition to RRM control, this includes all the SON applications.</p>
<p>Turning to the outer two control loops, the Near RT-RIC opens the
possibility of policy-based RAN control, whereby interrupts
(exceptions) to these policies would signal the need for the outer
loop to become involved. These policies would then be delivered to the
Near RT-RIC from the Management Plane over the A1 interface. For
example, one can imagine developing learning-based controls, where the
inference engines for these controls would run as part applications on
the Near RT-RIC, and their non-realtime learning counterparts would
run elsewhere. The Non-RT RIC would then interact with the Near-RT RIC
to deliver relevant operator policies from the Management Plane to the
Near RT-RIC.</p>
<p>Finally, you may be wondering why there is an O-RAN Alliance in the
first place, given that 3GPP is already the standardization body
responsible for interoperability across the global cellular network.
The answer is that over time 3GPP has become a vendor-dominated
organization, whereas O-RAN was created more recently by network
operators. (AT&amp;T and China Mobile were the founding members.) O-RAN’s
goal is to catalyze a software-based implementation that breaks the
vendor lock-in that dominates today’s marketplace. The E2 interface
in particular, which is architected around the idea of supporting
different Service Models, is central to this strategy. Whether the
operators will be successful in their ultimate goal is yet to be seen.</p>
